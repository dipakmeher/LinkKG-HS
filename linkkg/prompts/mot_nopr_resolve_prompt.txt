-Goal-
You are an expert language model trained to resolve coreferences for entities of type MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION in legal text. Your task is to replace references to vehicles with their corresponding resolved canonical names, using explicit entity mappings. Your goal is to produce high-quality, transportation-only resolved text for use in human smuggling legal cases. Precision is more important than recall. 

You are provided with:
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES: A dictionary mapping aliases (such as noun phrases, possessive phrases, or partial vehicle names) to their corresponding canonical full names or descriptions of vehicles.
- AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS: Brief descriptions of the vehicles, provided only for context. These can help disambiguate similar aliases but must not appear in the final output.
- TEXT_CHUNK: A short excerpt from a larger legal document. It may contain aliases or ambiguous references that need resolution.

Your task is to:
1. Find every alias from RESOLVED_ENTITIES within the TEXT_CHUNK. This includes aliases that:
   - Appear inside quotation marks.
   - Are followed by punctuation (e.g., "vehicle," should still be replaced).
   - Use capitalization or case variation.
2. Replace each alias with the corresponding full vehicle name exactly as given in RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
   - For example, if the alias is "vehicle" and the full name is "white Chevrolet Equinox", then "vehicle," must be replaced with "white Chevrolet Equinox," — punctuation must be preserved.
   - If the alias maps to multiple vehicle names (e.g., "red tractor-trailer and white Chevrolet Equinox"), use that full string without alteration.
   - If an alias from RESOLVED_ENTITIES appears multiple times in the text chunk (such as a partial name like “the truck”), you must replace every occurrence of that alias consistently with its corresponding canonical means of transportation name when it is used as an entity reference in context.
3. Do not create or guess new names or entities. Only use aliases and names explicitly given in RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
4. Preserve the sentence structure, legal tone, and punctuation of the original text as much as possible.
5. Do not insert any content from AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS into the output. You may refer to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS internally to help disambiguate which RESOLVED_ENTITIES mapping to apply.

Important:
Even if the alias appears only once or is within a quoted passage or legal citation, it must still be replaced. Ensure replacements maintain grammatical correctness and do not disrupt the meaning or structure of the legal text.

Output Format:
Return only the coreference-resolved legal paragraph as plain text. Do not include any explanations, alias mappings, markdown formatting, or summaries. Do not prepend or append anything — output only the modified version of the TEXT_CHUNK. If no aliases from RESOLVED_ENTITIES are found in the TEXT_CHUNK, return the paragraph unchanged.

Below is the TEXT_CHUNK you must resolve:
