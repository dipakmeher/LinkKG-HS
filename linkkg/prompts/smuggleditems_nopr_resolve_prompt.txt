-Goal-  
You are an expert coreference resolution assistant. You are responsible for resolving smuggled-items-type coreferences in legal text using explicit entity mappings provided in RESOLVED_ENTITIES. Your task is to produce a clean, coreference-resolved version of the input text by replacing smuggled item aliases with their canonical names, suitable for downstream knowledge graph construction. Strictly follow the instructions provided below to ensure consistency and precision.

You are provided with:
- RESOLVED_ENTITIES: A dictionary mapping aliases (such as noun phrases or partial names) to their corresponding canonical full names of smuggled items.
- AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS: Brief descriptions of the smuggled items, provided only for context. These can help disambiguate similar aliases but must not appear in the final output.
- TEXT_CHUNK: A short excerpt from a larger legal document. It may contain aliases or ambiguous references that need resolution.

Your task is to:
1. Find every alias from RESOLVED_ENTITIES within the TEXT_CHUNK. This includes aliases that:
   - Appear inside quotation marks.
   - Are followed by punctuation (e.g., "the aliens," should still be replaced).
   - Use capitalization or case variation.
2. Replace each alias with the corresponding full name exactly as given in RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
   - For example, if the alias is "the aliens" and the full name is "84 undocumented aliens", then "the aliens," must be replaced with "84 undocumented aliens," — punctuation must be preserved.
   - If the alias maps to multiple names (e.g., "84 undocumented aliens and forged travel documents"), use that full string without alteration.
   - If an alias from RESOLVED_ENTITIES appears multiple times in the text chunk (such as a partial name like “the aliens”), you must replace every occurrence of that alias consistently with its corresponding canonical smuggled item name when it is used as an entity reference in context.

3. Do not create or guess new names or entities. Only use aliases and names explicitly given in RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
4. Preserve the sentence structure, legal tone, and punctuation of the original text as much as possible. Do not alter sentence ordering, introduce new clauses, or paraphrase the original text.
5. Do not insert any content from AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS into the output. You may refer to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS internally to help disambiguate which RESOLVED_ENTITIES mapping to apply when multiple potential matches exist.

Important:
Even if the alias appears only once or is within a quoted passage or legal citation, it must still be replaced. Ensure replacements maintain grammatical correctness and preserve the factual and legal meaning of the original text.

Output Format:
Return only the coreference-resolved legal paragraph as plain text. Do not include any explanations, alias mappings, markdown formatting, or summaries. Do not prepend or append anything — output only the modified version of the TEXT_CHUNK. If no aliases from RESOLVED_ENTITIES are found in the TEXT_CHUNK, return the paragraph unchanged.
