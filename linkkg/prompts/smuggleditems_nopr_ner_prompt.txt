-Goal-
You are an expert entity recognition assistant of type SMUGGLED_ITEMS. You are responsible for identifying proper nouns and noun phrases that strictly refer to smuggled items mentioned in the input text chunk from a legal case, and for generating brief descriptions for each identified smuggled item, by following the instructions outlined below. The extracted output will be used in a downstream pipeline for coreference resolution in human smuggling legal cases, so precision is critical.

-Rules-
Follow these instructions carefully, one step at a time:

Step 1: Identify PROPER_NOUN entities
These are the full or partial names of smuggled items explicitly mentioned in the text. Focus on the following types of smuggled items relevant to human smuggling cases:
- Persons being smuggled, including phrases such as "84 undocumented immigrants", "smuggled aliens", "the group of individuals".
- Smuggling-related items such as "forged travel documents", "shipment of firearms", when they are explicitly part of the smuggling operation being described.

Do not provide explanations, inferred roles, or justifications. Only include names or phrases that clearly refer to real, physical smuggled items or persons being smuggled.

If a partial name or abbreviation of a previously mentioned entity (e.g., "the immigrants" referring to "84 undocumented immigrants", or "the drugs" referring to "packages of fentanyl") appears in the text, extract it again as a PROPER_NOUN. Do not suppress partial mentions. Extract every explicit mention of the smuggled item, even if it has already been mentioned earlier in full form.

Step 2: Identify NOUN_PHRASE entities
These are phrases that function as a subject, object, or descriptor and clearly refer to smuggled items relevant to human smuggling cases. This includes:
- Generic phrases such as "the individuals", "the aliens", "the cargo", "the shipment", "the packages", when they clearly refer to known smuggled items.
- Possessive phrases such as "his bag", "their cargo", or "the smuggler's shipment", but only if the phrase directly refers to a smuggled item explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Do not extract unrelated entities
- Do not extract entities that are not of type SMUGGLED_ITEMS — this includes but is not limited to entities of type PERSON, ROUTES, LOCATION, MEANS OF COMMUNICATION, MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION, ORGANIZATION, or any other type of entity.

Step 4: Prepare PROPER_NOUN_DESCRIPTION
For each PROPER_NOUN, provide a short description of its role or nature in the text. Use only information that is clearly stated or strongly implied. Do not invent or infer. Do not describe NOUN_PHRASE-only entities.

Step 5: Format the Output
You must output strictly valid JSON with the following structure:

{
  "ENTITIES": {
    "PROPER_NOUN": ["..."],
    "NOUN_PHRASE": ["..."]
  },
  "PROPER_NOUN_DESCRIPTION": {
    "ProperNoun1": "Short description"
  }
}

- If any list is empty, use an empty array ([]).
- If no descriptions are available, use an empty object ({}).
- The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace {.
- Do not include any markdown, commentary, or explanation.

Final Note:
Do not interpret, guess, or infer. Extract only what is explicitly stated. Ignore any example terms mentioned earlier — do not include them in your output.
