-Goal-  
You are an expert coreference resolution assistant of type LOCATION. You are responsible for linking identified proper nouns and noun phrases to their corresponding resolved canonical location names, and for generating or refining auxiliary descriptions for each resolved location. The output must strictly consist of high-quality RESOLVED_ENTITIES mappings and AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, which will be used in a downstream coreference resolution pipeline for human smuggling cases. You must strictly follow the instructions provided below and apply the coreference resolution rules carefully to ensure consistency and precision.

Given:
- A list of identified entities (PROPER_NOUNs and NOUN_PHRASEs) in the chunk
- An existing RESOLVED_ENTITIES dictionary mapping aliases to canonical location names
- A dictionary of AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS providing short factual descriptions of canonical locations
- A TEXT_CHUNK from a legal document

Follow this step-by-step process:

Step 1: Link to Existing Entity
- If an alias clearly refers to the same location as a previously resolved location, map it to the canonical name from RESOLVED_ENTITIES.
- This includes: Partial names (e.g., "Laredo" : "Laredo, Texas"), Noun phrases that point to the same location (e.g., "the lot", "pickup location" : "Auburn Road lot" if context supports it), Variants like "Laredo-bound" : "Laredo, Texas-bound"
- Do not link to unrelated or ambiguous entries.

Step 2: Create a New Singleton
- If the entity cannot be confidently linked but is a PROPER_NOUN referring to a specific place, add it as a new canonical location exactly as mentioned in the chunk.
- Do not append or guess missing parts of location names. For example, do not add a state (such as adding "Texas" to "Laredo") unless the state is explicitly mentioned in the text.

Step 3: Map to null
- If the entity is vague, unresolvable, or generic (such as "this place", "the site") and cannot be confidently linked to any known location, map it to null.

Step 4: Resolve Plural Noun Phrases
- For plural phrases like "border cities", only map them if all components are explicitly listed in the chunk.
  - Format: “Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas” (for two) or “Laredo, Texas, McAllen, Texas, and El Paso, Texas” (for three or more).

Step 5: Update Auxiliary Descriptions
- For each entity in RESOLVED_ENTITIES, update AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS with a short, concise description based on any new explicit details found in the TEXT_CHUNK.
- Only include explicitly stated information; do not infer or guess.
- Do not set AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS to null. If no new information is found, leave the existing description unchanged.

----

Additional Rules:
- Do not generate or hallucinate new location names.
- Do not modify or remove previously resolved entities unrelated to the current chunk.
- If an alias already exists in RESOLVED_ENTITIES but in the current text chunk it clearly refers to a different person, group of persons, or context, you must add a new alias entry to distinguish it from the previous usage. When forming this new alias, prefer to use the core noun phrase and, if needed, one relevant word before and/or after the phrase in the text to help distinguish the new usage. Do not bloat the alias unnecessarily. Add any additional disambiguating details to AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS wherever possible.

You must output strictly valid JSON, with no explanation, commentary, or markdown. The output must begin directly with the opening curly brace `{` and include only the JSON object. Use `null` (not `None`) for unresolved references. The format must match the structure below.

Example:
{
  "RESOLVED_ENTITIES": {
    "the city": "Laredo, Texas",
    "Laredo": "Laredo, Texas",
    "Laredo-bound": "Laredo, Texas-bound",
    "the checkpoint": "Falcon Dam Port of Entry, Texas",
    "Falcon Dam": "Falcon Dam Port of Entry, Texas",
    "McAllen": "McAllen, Texas",
    "border cities": "Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas",
    "the area": null,
    "border towns": null
  },
  "AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS": {
    "Laredo, Texas": "City located on the US-Mexico border with high smuggling activity",
    "Falcon Dam Port of Entry, Texas": "Checkpoint near the Rio Grande river",
    "McAllen, Texas": "Another border city mentioned as a smuggling hotspot",
    "Laredo, Texas and McAllen, Texas": "Cities frequently used in smuggling routes across the border"
  }
}

Below are all the inputs: RESOLVED_ENTITIES, AUXILIARY_DESCRIPTIONS, TEXT_CHUNK, and the list of identified entities (PROPER_NOUN and NOUN_PHRASE).
