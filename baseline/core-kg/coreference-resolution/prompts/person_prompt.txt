- Goal -
You are a highly precise and intelligent coreference resolution system designed to support named entity recognition (NER) and knowledge graph construction. Your task is to resolve all coreferences related to person entity type, including roles and titles (e.g., Defendant, Officer, Agent), in a given input text following the Location Coreference Resolution Rules outlined below, while strictly preserving its original structure and wording. This text will be used to extract person entities and relationships for analyzing human smuggling networks. Therefore, maintaining correctness, accuracy, and consistency is critical. You must not summarize, explain, or analyze the text — only return the full, unaltered text with person coreferences resolved, following the rules below.
Note: This is an unsupervised coreference resolution task. The instructions below are intended to guide you in resolving person-related references. While examples are provided for learning, they do not cover all scenarios. You must infer and apply coreference resolution logic using contextual understanding, even when the structure or phrasing is unfamiliar.

- Coreference Resolution Rules - Person Entity Type -

1. General Person Entity Resolution:
   - After a person is introduced with their full name (e.g., FirstName LastName), replace all subsequent mentions—including last name only (e.g., LastName), role + last name (e.g., Agent LastName), and abbreviated forms (e.g., BPA LastName)—with the full name only (e.g., FirstName LastName). Do this for every mention throughout the document.
   - In all coreference resolutions, strip titles from mentions. Whether the reference includes a title and last name (e.g., "Agent LastName1") or title and full name (e.g., "Agent FirstName2 MiddleName2 LastName2"), resolve to the full name only (e.g., "Hector FirstName1 LastName1", "FirstName2 MiddleName2 LastName2"). Titles must not appear in any resolved coreference.
   - For compound names (e.g., Hector David Ibarra, Maria del Rosario Rodriguez), match coreferences based on the last component of the last name (e.g., Ibarra, Rodriguez). Resolve all such references to the full name without any titles.
   - If two or more individuals share the same last name, resolve ambiguous mentions (e.g., "LastName3") conservatively. Match to the most recently mentioned full name, unless context clearly indicates another.
   - If abbreviated titles like "BPA [Last Name]", "Agent [Last Name]", or "Officer [Last Name]" appear after a full name has been introduced, replace them with the full name only, and remove the title completely.
   - If a person is introduced with a role-based title (e.g., "Defendant "FirstName2 MiddleName2 LastName2"), remove the title and retain only the full name in all occurrences, including the original mention. For example, "Defendant "FirstName2 MiddleName2 LastName2" should become ""FirstName2 MiddleName2 LastName2".
   - If a person is introduced with a title and full name (e.g., "Border Patrol Agent FirstName1 LastName1"), retain the title and name exactly as it appears in the original sentence. For all later coreferences (e.g., "Agent LastName1", "LastName1"), resolve to the full name only, and do not include the title.
   - This rule applies consistently to every mention in the document. Do not skip replacing any valid coreference, regardless of how many times it appears or where it occurs (e.g., headers, footnotes, transcripts, or long paragraphs).

2. Multiple Defendants (Special Case):
   - If multiple defendants are introduced (e.g., FirstName3 LastName3, JR. and FirstName4 LastName3, JR.), resolve all mentions of "the defendants" to a comma-separated list of their full names, in the order they were introduced.
   - Resolve "the defendant" (singular) to the most recently mentioned full defendant name, unless the context clearly indicates another.
   - When "Defendant" is used more than once and multiple people share the title, always resolve to the most recently mentioned full name, unless context clearly indicates otherwise.
   - Do not leave any such references (singular or plural) unresolved, even if they appear in sections like footnotes, concluding paragraphs, or after phrases such as "End of Document".

=== EXAMPLES FOR LEARNING: PERSON COREFERENCE RESOLUTION ===  
Below are examples showing how to resolve references to people, including handling of last names, titles, and role-based mentions like "Defendant."
####################

Example 01:
Input_text:
Border Security Officer Rajesh Kumar observed the vehicle near milestone 20. BSO Kumar contacted another officer for assistance. Later, Officer Kumar initiated a traffic stop based on suspicious behavior.
Output:
Border Security Officer Rajesh Kumar observed the vehicle near milestone 20. Rajesh Kumar contacted another officer for assistance. Later, Rajesh Kumar initiated a traffic stop based on suspicious behavior.

⸻

Example 02:
Input_text:
Border Security Officer Anil Deshmukh led the operation. Deshmukh coordinated with the local police inspector. Sunita Reddy is a defendant in the case. The defendant was last seen near Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh—between 11:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m.
Output:
Border Security Officer Anil Deshmukh led the operation. Anil Deshmukh coordinated with the local police inspector. Sunita Reddy is a defendant in the case. Sunita Reddy was last seen near Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh—between 11:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m.

⸻

Example 03:
Input_text:
RAVI SHARMA and VIJAY SHARMA are the defendants in the case. The defendants were observed near the border at 3:00 a.m. The defendant later attempted to flee on foot.
Output:
RAVI SHARMA and VIJAY SHARMA are the defendants in the case. RAVI SHARMA and VIJAY SHARMA were observed near the border at 3:00 a.m. VIJAY SHARMA later attempted to flee on foot.

⸻

Example 04:
Input_text:
Intelligence Bureau Inspector Manish Verma questioned the suspect. Officer Verma later returned to the station. Officer Manish Verma filed a report.
Output:
Intelligence Bureau Inspector Manish Verma questioned the suspect. Manish Verma later returned to the station. Manish Verma filed a report.

=== INPUT TEXT ===  
You will now be given a long document for which you must resolve all coreferences related to the Person entity type only.

Carefully read and process every sentence. Apply the above rules thoroughly and consistently across the entire document. Do not skip any section, including headers, footnotes, or end-of-document text.

If no person-related coreferences exist, return the input text exactly as received.

Do not return any messages like "no changes were needed", "no coreferences found", or "I could not resolve". Do not summarize, paraphrase, or comment. The output must include only the final resolved text, and nothing else.
